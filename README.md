## A2: View Source

Edit the `index.html` file with the following:
- Add appropriate structural HTML tags (doctype, html, head, body, etc.) 
- Add some media to this page, like an image of your favorite animal.
- Using an ordered list, write step by step instructions for viewing the HTML source of a web page in your favorite browser. Include the name of the browser.
- Invent and add a new unique metaphor for this action (e.g. “Looking under the hood”) 
- Style your page with CSS 
- Confirm your page uses valid [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

Bonus: Add a table with your weekly dream schedule (what you will do when the robots take over)
